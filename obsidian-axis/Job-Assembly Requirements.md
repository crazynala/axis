### Quantities
- Qty ordered must be editable

### Costings
- [ ] Qty / Unit must be editable if and only if the costing.product does not have batch inventory tracked, or no units in the assembly have been cut. The UI should work like the quantity ordered (inline field taking up the whole cell)
- [ ] Sell price must auto-update per the ordered qty

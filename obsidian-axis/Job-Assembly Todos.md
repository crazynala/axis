- [x] When order quantity is changed in Quantities table, the save/cancel header must show (via the globalformcontext, triggered by RHF dirty state). It currently has it's own save/cancel button, which is not our UX pattern
- [x] The "add" button for the Costings card is no longer present (regression issue) -- note there is an unused AddCostingButton function in the route
- [x] Support editing of Assembly name
- [x] No states show in state transition button

- [x] Show single state button for groups
- [ ] Add Costing Modal
	- [ ] Typing into Search products... does nothing
	- [ ] Default results different for single- vs multi-assembly
	- [ ] Remove "Qty / Unit" and Unit Cost from Add Costing modal
	- [ ] Flag for customer-specific products
- [x] Move ID to bottom of card
- [x] Quantities table must be centered
- [x] The recordcontext must show the number of assemblies, not the number of jobs. The job becomes the "parent". Remove extraneous Prev/Next buttons
- [ ] Hitting Esc on job/assembly must take us back to job detail (not all the way back to job index)
- [x] Add record make
- [ ] Add record ship
- [ ] Add record defect
	- [ ] Support defect for Cut or Sew
- [ ] Form still dirty after saving (e.g. after updating order qty)
- [ ] Assembly must have type (prod | SMS | PP | Keep)
- [ ] Don't add the "Assembly make output" note to batches created from assembly
- [ ] When user deletes activities, what should we do with assembly & job states?
	- User can't currently go back from Fully Cut > Partially Cut > Cut Planned

### Record Cut/Make
- [ ] Set Material Consumption to "Job Location" by default
- [ ] Open accordion for first material by default
- [ ] Don't show material consumption section if there are no materials to consume
- [ ] Currently labeling assembly size breakdown tables like "Assembly A2". Change to Assembly Name (Type)
- [ ] '0' values add clutter
- [ ] Don't include materials that are not tracked in inventory (eg make is showing CMT)
- [ ] When state is Fully Cut, don't show cut actionIcon
- [ ] When state is Complete, On Hold, don't show cut / make / pack actionIcons

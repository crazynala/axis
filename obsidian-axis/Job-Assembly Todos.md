- [x] When order quantity is changed in Quantities table, the save/cancel header must show (via the globalformcontext, triggered by RHF dirty state). It currently has it's own save/cancel button, which is not our UX pattern
- [x] The "add" button for the Costings card is no longer present (regression issue) -- note there is an unused AddCostingButton function in the route
- [x] Support editing of Assembly name
- [ ] No states show in state transition button
- [ ] Assemblies must be in same state to group
- [ ] Show single state button for groups
- [ ] Add Costing Modal
	- [ ] Typing into Search products... does nothing
	- [ ] Default results different for single- vs multi-assembly
	- [ ] Remove "Qty / Unit" and Unit Cost from Add Costing modal
	- [ ] Flag for customer-specific products
- [x] Move ID to bottom of card
- [x] Quantities table must be centered
- [x] The recordcontext must show the number of assemblies, not the number of jobs. The job becomes the "parent". Remove extraneous Prev/Next buttons
- [ ] Hitting Esc on job/assembly must take us back to job detail (not all the way back to job index)
- [ ] Add record make
- [ ] Add record ship
- [ ] Add record defect
	- [ ] Support defect for Cut or Sew
- [ ] Form still dirty after saving (e.g. after updating order qty)
- [ ] Assembly must have type (prod | SMS | PP | Keep)
